# GUI4REST
A no-bloat GUI client for REST APIs

Back to the basics of what's essential in a REST API client:
- Light and light on its feet
- Configurable yet stays out of your way
- Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD... all aboard!
- Light & dark Theming
- Compiles to a single statically-linked executable: zero external dependencies
- Zero embedded phone-home elements
